# Automating Parcel Plotting in ArcGIS Pro with Python

Description: This project automates the plotting of parcels on a 2D map in ArcGIS Pro using a Python script. The script reads a TXT file containing coordinates in degrees, minutes, seconds, directions (N/S/E/W), and distances. It then converts the coordinates to XY points and uses the arcpy library to access the Traverse Tool and automatically plot each point on the map as polygons.

Who is it for? This project was made for the GIS team during my internship with the Harris County Engineering Department as a geospatial software development intern

# Visual Results:
In this section, I have included images that demonstrates the final product of my code. The green figures were made manually which takes about 2-5 minutes to generate. The figure with a distinct color was made using my code automatically which takes less than 3 seconds to generate.

## Green Color Figure: 
    Manually drawn parcel (2-5 minutes to generate)

## Distinct Color Figure: 
    Parcel generated by my code (less than 3 seconds to generate)
